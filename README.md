## How this repository is organized

This repository contains the following **directories**.

1. `workshops`  
    Each folder within corresponds to a particular category of workshops. It contains all the files that were utilized during the workshop. Most importantly, it contains the **PDF file** of the presentation. Large data or installation files that were downloaded during the workshop are not included. In the event that multiple workshops were conducted for the same topic, the folder will contain subfolders for each workshop. Some example files and folders within this folder are:
    - `data_folder`
    - `workshop-slides.pdf`
    - `jupyter-notebook.ipynb`
